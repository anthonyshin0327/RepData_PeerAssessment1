# Description

There are a total of three files in this repository:

1. 241203_Reproducible Research Module 2 Project 1.html
2. 241210_RepResearch_Mod2Proj1.Rmd
3. activity.zip

The `activity.zip` file contains the original dataset. Make sure to download it to your Downloads filepath, especially if you are a Mac User, since the Rmd code specifies that the `csv` file loads from your Download filepath.

The 241210_ file contains the Rmd code, which will then properly load the data. The 241203_ file contains the pre-converted html file in case the Rmd does not work as intended. 

For any questions, please feel free to leave it in the feedback box for the assignment submission. Thank you.
